# Password Generator

## Purpose
To provide the user with a randomly generated password

### Installation/Usage
Visit this link https://mstrikethrough.github.io/password-generator/

#### Extras
This page allows you to choose a password length, but only input of numbers '8-128' are accepted. 
It is unknown how to store those selections and process them into a random string of characters
of the chosen length. Efforts were made to correct this, but proved futile.

Anyone may edit this page as they seem fit.
